# Dungeon Crawler (Labb2)

For my second school project, I developed a Dungeon Crawler game using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The project required designing a game that incorporates class hierarchy, map loading from a text file, a game loop, vision range, and a simple combat system where dice rolls determine the outcome against armor values. The game also featured two enemies with distinct movement patterns: a rat that moves randomly and a snake that retreats when the player approaches.

I was so enthusiastic about the project that I expanded it significantly by adding numerous features, including keys and locked doors, chests, health potions, a loot system, pushable blocks with collision detection, music and sound effects, warps, a magical barrier requiring a special key to pass, Mimics disguised as chests, two bosses, secret passages, arrow tiles that propel the player in a specified direction until collision, a main menu, and the ability to save and load the game using BSON files stored in a database

- Arrow keys to move
- D to drink health potions
- X to save game (using local connection on MongoDB)
